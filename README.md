# LoViT
This work is proposed for surgical phase recognition task, and the full code is not available now because of the patent and review process. But the extracted features and trained spatial feature extractor weight on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo are vailable now.

## The Trained Weight
The trained temporally-rich spatial feature extractor weight and the extracted features on Cholec80 and AutoLapro are available at:[OneDrive Link](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/k21073807_kcl_ac_uk/EpShcwpjssRGomJdcEhfZ68B6bNAt_WAVKfOrtrUfI-Bgw?e=YPJNpf).
